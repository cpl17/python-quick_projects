Improvements:

1. Find a way to scroll when you need it, not having to scroll all the way down 
2. Increase time between 


Problems:

- Non-dynamic screen scroll 
- Near the end the follow button is clicked but not followed 


Things to learn:

- arguments[0].scrollTop = arguments[0].scrollHeight <- What this is actually doing
